# The only animals in this house are cats
# Every animal that loves to gaze at the moon is suitable for a pet
# When I detest an animal, I avoid it
# No animals are carnivorous unless they prowl at night
# No cat fails to catch mice
# No animals ever take to me, except what are in this house
# Kangaroos are not suitable for pets
# None but carnivora kill mice
# I detest animals that do not take to me
# Animals that prowl at night always love to gaze at the moon
# Therefore, I always avoid a kangaroo

First, simplify the statements:

h - animals in the house
c - cats
p - animals suitable for pet n
g - animals that love to gaze at the moon
d - animals I detest
a - animals I avoid
v - carnivorous animals
n - animals prowl at night
m - killers of mice
t - aniamals that take to me
k - kangaroo

Work out the relationship between each statement. --> means entails, ~ is logical negation (NOT):

h --> c 
g --> p
d --> a (~a --> ~d)
v --> n
c --> m
t --> h
k --> ~p (p --> ~k)
m --> v
~t --> d (~d --> t)
n --> g

What does this imply?

~a --> ~d --> t --> h --> c --> m --> v --> n --> g --> p --> ~k

This can be reduced to:

~a --> ~k

Which means the opposite is true:

k --> a

Kangaroos are animals I avoid!
